        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                I work on a cybersecurity platform that protects and monitors AI agents and 
                MCP (Model Context Protocol) connections in organizations. In security, you 
                need fast feedback loops—getting features in front of security teams quickly 
                to learn what actually matters before committing full engineering resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as a product designer, I also needed to maintain visual consistency and 
                design system integrity. The challenge: deliver testable MVPs in one week 
                instead of three, while meeting the design quality standards that make user 
                feedback meaningful.
            </p>

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    Browser-based AI tools generated inconsistent code—random colors instead 
                    of design tokens, spacing that violated our grid, components that ignored 
                    our patterns. The "time savings" evaporated when I had to rewrite everything 
                    to meet design standards.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-box highlight">
                <h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
                <p>
                    Stopped using natural language and started using structured JSON specifications 
                    with exact design token references. Built a workflow connecting Claude, Figma 
                    Make, and Cursor through MCP to maintain consistency at every step.

                    <p class="timeline-description">
                        Mapped every Figma variable to its CSS token with exact syntax. 
                        Example: Figma <code>color/grey/200</code> → CSS 
                        <code>--igds-color-grey-200: #e8e9e9</code>. This became the 
                        foundation everything depends on—no arbitrary values, only token references.

                    <h3 class="timeline-title">Structured JSON Specifications</h3>
                    <p class="timeline-description">
                        Built a Claude skill that generates comprehensive JSON prompts from 
                        wireframes. Instead of natural language descriptions, I created structured 
                        specifications with component types, exact design token references, measurements, 
                        state variations, and accessibility requirements. JSON forces precision—AI 
                        stops guessing and starts executing exactly.

                    <p class="timeline-description">
                        Using the JSON specifications, Figma Make generates design-system-connected 
                        mockups that properly reference design tokens. Every color, spacing value, 
                        and typography choice comes from the token system—ensuring pixel-perfect 
                        fidelity to design standards before any code is written.

                    <p class="timeline-description">
                        Through Figma MCP, Cursor accesses design context directly, pulls Code 
                        Connect mappings, and composes components into our codebase with version 
                        management. The tools aren't working in isolation—they're connected to 
                        our design system and codebase through MCP. Context is everything.

        <h2 class="section-title">What Actually Mattered</h2>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                <strong>Structure beats speed:</strong> Browser tools were faster to start 
                but produced unusable output—random values, inconsistent spacing, ignored 
                design systems. The structured workflow took more setup but delivered testable 
                MVPs that enabled meaningful user feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Design quality as acceptance criteria:</strong> As a product designer, 
                I couldn't compromise on visual consistency or design system integrity. MVPs 
                need proper token usage, grid alignment, typography scale, and accessibility 
                to represent your product accurately. Speed without design quality wastes 
                user testing time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>JSON specifications enable consistency:</strong> Natural language 
                produces guesses. JSON with design token references produces predictable 
                implementations that meet design standards. When you give AI structured data 
                instead of prose, it stops guessing and starts executing precisely.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Integration over isolation:</strong> AI tools connected to our design 
                system through MCP dramatically outperformed isolated code generators. Tools 
                working in isolation can't maintain consistency. Tools connected to your design 
                system and codebase can.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Multiple specialized tools, orchestrated workflow:</strong> Claude Skills 
                for data structure, Figma Make for visuals, Cursor with MCP for integration. 
                Each tool specialized for its purpose, the workflow orchestrating them into 
                a coherent system that maintains design quality at every step.

                    The platform reached MVP in one week not because the code was perfect from 
                    the start—it reached MVP because we could iterate fast enough to get something 
                    testable in front of security teams before committing full engineering resources, 
                    and it met design quality standards that made the feedback meaningful.

                <p>
                    Client feedback revealed which AI agent monitoring features actually mattered. 
                    We validated core assumptions before investing in full production development. 
                    We learned what security teams needed for monitoring AI agents, discovered what 
                    to build before fully building it, and proved you don't have to sacrifice design 
                    quality for speed.
