            <p>
                During a customer support session at Ovalix, I watched a compliance officer at a
                financial services company configure an AI data sharing policy. She was controlling
                which email domains could share data with ChatGPT—a high-stakes AI governance task
                where wrong configuration could expose sensitive data to AI services.
            </p>
            <p>
                She knew exactly what she needed (regex would be perfect), but the existing tools
                forced an impossible choice between tedious repetitive entry and complex pattern
                matching. This quote became the foundation for everything that followed.

                    The breakthrough came from stopping to think of these as separate features.

                    <strong>Most important: behavioral change.</strong> Non-technical security
                    administrators started building PII detection patterns independently. Learning
                    happened through use, not documentation. Healthcare teams built HIPAA
                    compliance patterns in one afternoon. Finance teams created data classification
                    rules without developer support.

                    Customer teams sunset their spreadsheet-based AI governance workaround. The
                    tool became their source of truth for controlling which AI services employees
                    could use and what data could be shared.

                <h3>What Worked</h3>
                <p>
                    Progressive disclosure turned complexity into confidence. Template library
                    became educational content, not just shortcuts. Real-time validation
                    eliminated the biggest source of anxiety. Users felt smarter, not dumber.

            </div>
            <div class="insight-box highlight">
                <h3>What I'd Do Differently</h3>
                <p>
                    Add pattern testing feature earlier. Invest more in import intelligence for
                    edge cases. Plan for scale from the start—large lists need search and filter.
                    Consider natural language input carefully (powerful but needs guardrails).
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="quote-block">
            <p class="quote-text">
                "Good design isn't about hiding complexity—it's about revealing it at the right
                moment, with the right support. Sometimes the best interface makes users feel
                smarter than they did before."
            </p>
            <div class="quote-author">— Key Learning</div>

        <div class="text-block margin-top-xl">
            <p>
                <strong>Context beats documentation.</strong> Users learned regex through
                templates and immediate feedback, not manuals. Trust comes from transparency—seeing
                what will happen before it happens. Constraints (synchronous validation) became
                features (instant feedback).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Make complexity opt-in.</strong> The toggle isn't a switcher; it's an
                amplifier. Start simple, grow sophisticated. Same mental model, different depths.
                This approach works across domains—from AI governance to any interface bridging
                novice and expert users.
