            <p>
                Able Insights is a research and decision intelligence platform that connects 
                private data, proprietary datasets, and public sources to help corporate development 
                teams, market researchers, and investment analysts make informed decisions. The 
                platform offers access to 50+ data sources, AI-powered insights, and collaborative 
                research workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge was creating an onboarding experience that could serve three distinct 
                user personas—corporate development professionals, market researchers, and investment 
                analysts—each with different needs, workflows, and levels of technical expertise. 
                Users needed to quickly understand the platform's value and start their first 
                research project without getting lost in features.

                <p>
                    New users faced analysis paralysis when presented with 50+ data sources and 
                    multiple use cases. They needed guidance on where to start based on their 
                    specific role and goals, not a generic product tour.

                    Create a personalized walkthrough that adapts to the user's role and use 
                    case, guiding them to create their first research project while introducing 
                    only the features relevant to their workflow.

                        Instead of explaining features abstractly, the walkthrough demonstrates

                        reading descriptions of what it can do.

                        journey, not trapped in a rigid tutorial.

                    Rather than a single linear walkthrough, I designed a layered education

                    read best practices, or revisit the initial walkthrough. This serves users 
                    who prefer to explore first and learn later.

                <strong>Spotlight highlighting:</strong> Rather than covering the interface

                <strong>Graceful exits:</strong> At any point, users can exit the walkthrough 
                and return to normal use. A small indicator shows how far they've progressed, 
                and they can resume later if desired. There's no penalty for skipping.

                    The new walkthrough significantly improved user activation and retention. 
                    More importantly, qualitative feedback showed that users felt more confident 
                    exploring the product on their own after completing the onboarding.

                <p>
                    The layered approach proved particularly successful. Power users appreciated 
                    being able to skip the basic walkthrough, while novice users benefited from 
                    the structured guidance. By respecting different learning styles and experience 
                    levels, the design served a broader range of users effectively.

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                <strong>Onboarding is not a single moment:</strong> The best user education 
                happens across multiple touchpoints. A single comprehensive tutorial overwhelms; 
                small, contextual lessons throughout the experience work better.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Completion rate isn't everything:</strong> We optimized for user 
                confidence and long-term activation, not just walkthrough completion. Some users 
                who skip the tutorial entirely become highly engaged—and that's okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Test with real tasks, not toy examples:</strong> Early prototypes used 
                generic demo content. When we switched to realistic use cases, engagement 
                improved dramatically. Users need to see themselves in the examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Respect attention as a finite resource:</strong> Every second in an 
                onboarding flow has a cost. We ruthlessly prioritized what users truly needed 
                to know immediately versus what could wait until they needed it.
