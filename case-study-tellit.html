            An investor relations platform that transforms fundraising from scattered chaos
            into organized clarity. By replacing email black holes with beautiful, trackable

                <p>
                    Through interviews with 12 early-stage founders, five critical problems emerged.
                    What's at stake? Founders are losing funding opportunities because they can't
                    identify warm leads. They're wasting precious runway on investors who'll never
                    engage. And they're walking into pitch meetings unprepared, without knowing what
                    concerns they need to address.

                <p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                Instead of emailing PDFs into a void, founders create beautiful investor pages
                that consolidate everything an investor needs in one shareable link. The key
                insight: <strong>Founders don't need another document management tool</strong>. They need
                a platform that treats investor relations as an ongoing relationship, not a
                one-time email blast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every design decision stemmed from three core principles:

                <p>
                    Instead of juggling multiple files and links, founders share a single
                    URL that contains pitch deck, team info, Q&A, and supporting materials.
                    Investors get everything they need without hunting through email threads.

                <p>
                    The hero section had to immediately convey professionalism while maintaining
                    approachability. I designed eight customizable themes that let founders express
                    different brand personalities—from minimal and sophisticated to bold and energetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The customization panel gives instant visual feedback as founders adjust colors
                    and themes. But notice the constraints: I'm not giving unlimited customization,
                    because too much freedom creates ugly pages. Instead, I designed eight pre-balanced
                    themes and let founders choose colors within guardrails that ensure sufficient contrast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach gives founders ownership over their visual identity while preventing
                    truly bad design decisions.

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                <strong>Investors invest in people, not just ideas.</strong> I designed the team
                section as a clean grid of headshots with minimal decoration—no fancy animations
                that would distract from the faces themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                The value proposition section uses a two-column layout with generous paragraph
                space and that signature magenta accent bar you see throughout the system. That
                electric pink serves as the platform's energy source—in a category dominated by
                blues, I wanted Tellit to feel distinctly different. Magenta conveys creativity,
                confidence, and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I paired it with restraint. The near-black text and generous whitespace create
                breathing room, preventing the accent from overwhelming.

                <p>
                    This Q&A section was one of the most important design challenges. Instead of
                    waiting for investors to email questions—which creates friction and delays—founders
                    can preemptively answer the questions they know investors will ask.

                <p>
                    I designed a clean accordion pattern with smooth expansion animations and that
                    blue accent bar showing the active question. The analytics dashboard tracks which

            <p>
                I started by listing every metric we could track—20+ potential data points. Then
                I ruthlessly prioritized based on one question: <strong>What decisions do founders
                need to make?</strong>

                The final dashboard focuses on four core insights: <strong>Who's interested?

                    From day one, I knew this needed a proper design system. Tellit isn't just one
                    page—it's marketing site, investor pages, editor views, analytics dashboards,
                    and settings panels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built a token-based system where every color, spacing value, and typography
                    size references a central source of truth. The accent color appears consistently
                    across CTAs, section dividers, and interactive elements. The spacing system uses
                    a 4px base unit with Fibonacci-inspired scaling that creates natural rhythm.
                </p>

                    the answer isn't more clever information architecture—it's less. The sectioned
                    scroll is technically the simplest solution, but it took three iterations to

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                One of the most valuable pieces of feedback came from an early access founder.
                Our initial design had separate permission levels for decks, one-pagers, and
                other materials—very granular control.
            </p>
            <p>
                That single piece of feedback led us to simplify to <strong>global access control
                per lead</strong>. One toggle: access or no access. The entire access management
                system became 3x simpler, and founders actually used it instead of ignoring it
                because it was too complex.
            </p>
            <p>
                This taught me: <strong>Sometimes founders don't want more control. They want
                less cognitive load.</strong>

                    it overwhelming and often just gave everyone full access.

                It's the system that makes everything consistent. The constraints that prevent
